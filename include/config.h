// HIDDEN_ABILITIES defines whether or not Pokémon with their hidden ability bit set will receive their hidden abilities when being generated/changing form in battle.
// commenting this line out essentially disables hidden abilities to maintain default behavior, while leaving this as-is will introduce hidden abilities and all of their handling.

// PRIMAL_REVERSION defines whether or not Kyogre and Groudon, when holding their orbs, will be able to change form when sent out in battle.

// IMPLEMENT_LEVEL_CAP defines whether or not a configurable hard level cap system is built into the rom based on the value in LEVEL_CAP_VARIABLE
// if the level is greater than or equal to LEVEL_CAP_VARIABLE, the pokémon will no longer gain experience
// uncommenting IMPLEMENT_LEVEL_CAP enables the level cap system.  undefining LEVEL_CAP_VARIABLE will just cause compilation errors
