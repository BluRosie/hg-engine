Oh, man... My boss is going to be\nangry...\rThe Farfetch’d that cut trees for\ncharcoal took off in the forest.\rCan you catch them for me?\nFarfetch’d have sensitive ears.\rIf you step on a branch, they will face\ntoward you. That’s your chance.\rSneak up from behind and catch them...\nDo you think you can do that?
Wow! You found a Farfetch’d!\nThank you!\rBut...\nThere is one more missing.\rIf you step on a branch, it will face\nthat way, remember?\rThat’s your chance to catch it.\nSneak up on it slowly from behind.
Wow!\nYou got me both of them.\fThank you so much!\rMy boss’s Pokémon won’t obey me,\nbecause I don’t have a Badge.\rPhew. You saved me.
Farfetch’d: Kwaa!\r
Farfetch’d: Kwaa!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} caught the Farfetch’d!\r
Ah!\nMy Far and Fetch’d!\rYou found them for us, kid?\nWithout them, we wouldn’t be able to\fcut trees for charcoal.\rThanks, kid!\rNow, how can I thank you...?\nI know! Here, take this.\r
                      
That’s the Hm Cut. Teach that to a\nPokémon to clear small trees.\rOf course, you have to have the Gym\nBadge from Azalea to use it.
               
Do you want to apprentice as a charcoal\nmaker with me?\rYou’ll be first-rate in ten years!
What am I doing?\rI’m shaking trees using Headbutt.\rIt’s fun. Here, you try it with your\nPokémon, too! {YESNO 0}
Do you want to try it with your\nPokémon? {YESNO 0}
I see...\nTake care of its head.
Which Pokémon should learn it?\r
Hmmm...\nEven I couldn’t teach an Egg a move.\r
Sorry...\nThat Pokémon cannot learn Headbutt.\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} is trying to learn\nHeadbutt.\rBut {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} can’t learn more\nthan four moves.\rDelete an older move to make\nroom for Headbutt? {YESNO 0}
Is it Ok to forget the\nmove {STRVAR_1 6, 1, 0}? {YESNO 0}
Stop trying to teach Headbutt? {YESNO 0}
1,{PAUSE 20} 2,{PAUSE 20} and...{PAUSE 20} ...{PAUSE 20} Poof!
1,{PAUSE 20} 2,{PAUSE 20} and...{PAUSE 20} ...{PAUSE 20} Poof!
There. How do you like it?\nYour {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0} looks stronger!
Your {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0}\nhas already learned Headbutt.\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} forgot how to\nuse {STRVAR_1 6, 1, 0}.\rAnd...
{STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} learned Headbutt.
{STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} learned Headbutt!
Trainer Tips!\rIlex Forest is so overgrown with trees\nthat you can’t see the sky.\rPlease watch out for items that may\nhave been dropped.
Ilex Forest Shrine...\rIt’s a tribute to the forest’s\nprotector...
Kimono Girl, Kimono Girl, lost and all\nalone. Poor girl lost in the dark\fIlex Forest.\r
What?\nYou remember me from Violet City?\fYou must be imagining.\rAnyway, will you show me\nhow to get out of this forest? {YESNO 0}
You will...?\nAren’t you lost in the forest as well?\fHow do you know how to get out of here?\r
Me oh my...\nYou are lost yourself, aren’t you?\r
Wow! Are you going to\nshow me how to get out?\fYou are such a smart Pokémon!\r
See you.\r
Farfetch’d noticed you!\nIt seems to face the direction of the\fnoise when you step on a branch.
You need to catch it from behind.
You snuck up and caught it from\nbehind before it noticed you!
It’s a Pichu...!\nOne of its ears is spiky!\r
It wants to join your party.\nLet it join you!\r
Spiky-eared Pichu has joined\nyour party!
...Your party is full!\r
...Your party is full!\rFirst go store a Pokémon in a Pc Box.
Spiky-eared Pichu: Zapzap chu!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received the Poké Ball!
Would you like to give a nickname\nto the Spiky-eared Pichu? {YESNO 0}
Hey, hey!\nYou should not tamper with that shrine!\fPeople are said to disappear.\r
Kids and Pokémon sometimes disappear\naround this shrine.\rIt is believed that a Pokémon which\nwanders across time does that.\rIt is truly a strange thing...\r
Well, well, this must be...\rThis must be the Pichu that has lived in\nthis forest for some time.\rWhen I saw it the first time, it looked\nlonely. It is full of energy today.\r
I see.\nIt seems that these old friends\ffinally meet again after a long time.\r
You are carrying a lot of Pokémon.\rWhy don’t you store one of them\nat the Pokémon Center?\fI will take care of it in the mean time.
Being with friends should make it happy.\nTake good care of it.\r
Oh, here it is!\nYoung Pokémon Trainer,\fI will give you this Poké Ball.\rI used to use them when I was younger.\rDon’t worry.\nIt’s still in good condition.\r
It seems that Spiky-eared Pichu\nwants to stay in your Poké Ball.\r
You named it {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}?\nSuch a cute name!\r
It’s been waiting for you\nall this time.\rTalk to it. That’ll make it happy.

Lyra: Traveling through time\nsure doesn’t feel good.\r
Hey, my Marill!\r
Hey, my Marill!\r
I thought I would never see you again!\rWait a sec...\nSo we must be back to our time!\r
I missed you so much!\rWait a sec...\nSo we must be back to our time!\r
It was all so bizarre.\nBut now that we are safely back to our\ftime and Team Rocket’s terrible design\ffell through, we can say...\fall’s well that ends well, right?\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, you never cease to\ninspire great adventures!\rIt sure was an exhausting day, though.\nI better get going.\rSee you!\r
